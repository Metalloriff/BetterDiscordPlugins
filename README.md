# BetterDiscordPlugins

## NOTE: Due to loss of interest in BetterDiscord development, I'm pursuing other projects and no longer maintaining this repository. I will try to keep up with pull requests, but I will likely not be fixing any plugins myself. I apologize for the inconvenience. You can view my other projects at https://kinzoku.one, if you're interested.
